        <p>Hi! I am Tom Ralph, a <b>super cool</b> senior at Clements High School. Next year I will be attending Texas A&M to study Aeronautical Engineering.
	This year I took <i>Physics II AP</i> taught by my favorite teacher Mr. Hart. This website is made to showcase my labs, even though I'm not taking the AP.</p>
